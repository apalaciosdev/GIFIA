# Welcome to GIFIA!
GIFIA is a Gif filter and searcher that uses the Giphy API and provides a lot of Gifs.
If you want a simple and minimalist searcher for download or implement Gifs in your web, GIFIA it's perfect for you.

## Why I recommend use GIFIA?
Often I need use Gifs for projects. 
The main gif provider it's Giphy, but it has a problem: if you want to download any gif, you have to follow a lot steps (in my opinion) for do it. <br />
And if you want to implement a gif in your web or project, Giphy give you the link source, but it has a problem: **the watermark**. 
<img src="/public/watermark.gif?" alt="drawing" width="300"/>


<br />
For all these reasons, I developed a simple and minimalist searcher for do this 2 things, without unnecesary extra steps or watermarks.

- 3.- Search and check out.
